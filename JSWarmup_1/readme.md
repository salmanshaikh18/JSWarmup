:) Created a rectangle and when we move mouse on that rectangle on the left side we want to gradually change the color of the rectangle to red and when we move mouse to the right side we want to change the color to blue.

when we move mouse to left side make the rectangle slow down the more mouse reaches to the left and do the same when mouse goes to the right side 

:) Solution

1 -> First, we checked whether the mouse pointer came to the center of the rectangle and moved or not.

2 -> Now, we calculated whether we are to the left of the rectangle's center or to the right of the rectangle's center.
We use a gsap cdn for map range
